- 👋 Hi, I’m @moogacid - an R programming beginner seriously out of my depth!
- 👀 I’m interested in Geospatial data processing 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create an automated process for burial depth of subsea engineering structures.
- 💞️ Largely looking for help but I'd be happy to share the little things I've learnt.
